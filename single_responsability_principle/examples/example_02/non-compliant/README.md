This class violates the Single Responsibility Principle because it handles multiple tasks that are not directly related to each other. Let's examine:

1.  `getTitle()`: This method retrieves the book's title. This responsibility is related to providing information about the book's metadata.
    
2.  `getAuthor()`: This method retrieves the book's author. Similarly, this responsibility is related to providing information about the book's metadata.
    
3.  `printCurrentPage()`: This method prints the content of the current page. This responsibility is related to displaying the book's content.
    

Each of these methods serves a different purpose, and ideally, each class should have only one reason to change. In this case, if changes are required in how book titles are obtained, it would affect the same class that handles page printing, which violates the principle.

A better approach would be to divide responsibilities into separate classes. For example, a `Book` class could handle retrieving metadata such as title and author, while a `StandardOutPutPrinter` class could handle printing the book's content. This way, each class would have a single responsibility and would be less likely to change for unrelated reasons.
