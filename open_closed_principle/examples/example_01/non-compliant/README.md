The `Song` and `File` classes do not adhere to the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) because they are not open for extension without modifying their original source code. This principle states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

In this case, if we need to add additional functionalities or different behaviors to calculate the sent length percentage in other similar classes, we would have to directly modify the source code of these classes, which violates the principle. It would be more appropriate to have an interface or abstract base class that defines a common method `getSentLengthPercentage`, and then each concrete class (such as `Song` and `File`) could implement this method according to its specific rules. This way, we could extend the behavior without modifying the existing classes.
