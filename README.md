This repository contains practical examples in PHP illustrating the SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. The SOLID principles are a set of software design rules that help create cleaner, maintainable, and scalable code.

What is SOLID?
--------------

SOLID is an acronym representing five basic principles of software design:

*   **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one responsibility and reason to change.
    
*   **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    
*   **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without affecting the correctness of the program.
    
*   **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
    
*   **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level module details. Both should depend on abstractions.
    

These principles were coined by Robert C. Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob."

Why is it important to follow the SOLID principles?
---------------------------------------------------

Following the SOLID principles has several benefits:

*   **Maintainability**: The code is easier to understand and modify, reducing the time and risk associated with updates and bug fixes.
    
*   **Scalability**: SOLID-based systems are easier to extend and adapt as requirements change.
    
*   **Code Reusability**: Components following SOLID principles are more modular and can be reused in different parts of the system.
    

Why should one avoid STUPID?
----------------------------

The acronym STUPID represents characteristics opposed to the SOLID principles:

*   **S - Singleton**: The Singleton pattern creates shared global objects, making code testing and maintenance difficult.
    
*   **T - Tight Coupling**: Highly coupled classes are difficult to test and modify, as changes in one class can affect other classes.
    
*   **U - Untestability**: Code that cannot be easily tested is error-prone and hinders refactoring and system evolution.
    
*   **P - Premature Optimization**: Premature optimization can lead to complicated and hard-to-understand code, negatively impacting maintainability and code clarity.
    
*   **I - Indescriptive Naming**: Descriptive naming of variables and functions makes code comprehension and team collaboration difficult.
    
*   **D - Duplication**: Code duplication increases complexity and error risk, as changes must be made in multiple places.
    

Avoiding these characteristics helps maintain clean, clear, and easily maintainable code.
