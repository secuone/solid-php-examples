The Liskov Substitution Principle states that derived classes should be able to substitute their base classes without affecting the correct functioning of the program. In the case of the `Rectangle` and `Square` classes, there was initially a violation of this principle because a `Square` could not be fully substituted for a `Rectangle` without changing the expected behavior.

By refactoring the design and removing the inheritance between `Square` and `Rectangle`, and instead, making both implement a common interface (`Shape`), this violation has been eliminated. Now, any method expecting a `Shape` object can work with instances of both `Rectangle` and `Square` without introducing unexpected behaviors.

Furthermore, each class (`Rectangle` and `Square`) implements its own `getArea()` method consistently with its respective geometric shape. This ensures that the behavior of each class remains consistent and predictable, which is crucial for complying with the Liskov Substitution Principle.

In summary, by refactoring the design so that both classes implement a common interface and maintain consistent behavior with their respective geometric shapes, compliance with the Liskov Substitution Principle has been achieved. Now, the `Rectangle` and `Square` classes can be treated interchangeably where a `Shape` object is expected, without introducing unexpected behaviors or violations of the design principle.
