The presence of the `flush` method in the `UserRepository` interface can be problematic because some storage systems do not have a direct concept of "flush," as in the case of Redis.

When designing interfaces, we should consider the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), which states that clients should not depend on methods they do not use. In this case, if a user repository implementation needs to implement the `UserRepository` interface, it will be forced to provide an empty implementation or throw an exception for the `flush` method, which is not ideal.

In the end, our use case would look like this: after calling the `invoke` method, it will search for the user in the database to increment the total number of videos created and then persist this new state using the previously defined methods.

If we wanted to implement certain databases like Redis, which do not support the Unit of Work pattern, the call to the `flush` method would be unnecessary.
