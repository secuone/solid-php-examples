If we had a `PaymentGateway` class that implemented the `CreditCardProcessor` and `PayPalProcessor` interfaces and managed both payment methods, we would be complying with the ISP but not with the SRP, as the `PaymentGateway` class would have multiple responsibilities.

To solve this and maintain compliance with both principles, we can apply the delegation design pattern.

**CreditCardProcessor.php:** Defines the `CreditCardProcessor` interface with the `processCreditCardPayment()` method to process credit card payments. **PayPalProcessor.php:** Defines the `PayPalProcessor` interface with the `processPayPalPayment()` method to process payments through PayPal. **CreditCardPaymentGateway.php:** Implements the `CreditCardProcessor` interface in a dedicated class `CreditCardPaymentGateway`, which is solely responsible for processing credit card payments. **PayPalPaymentGateway.php:** Implements the `PayPalProcessor` interface in a dedicated class `PayPalPaymentGateway`, which is solely responsible for processing payments through PayPal.

Now, each class has a single responsibility: one is responsible for processing credit card payments and the other is responsible for processing payments through PayPal. This maintains compliance with both SRP and ISP simultaneously.

**Important:** Sometimes it is better to have duplicated code than a bad abstraction.
